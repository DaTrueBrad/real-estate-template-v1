# Real Estate Application

Welcome to the Real Estate Application! This web application provides a platform for users to browse properties available for sale or rent, filter them based on location and other criteria, access essential property documentation, and interact with property managers. The application consists of both Client and Admin interfaces, with the Admin side currently accessible for demonstration purposes only.

## Features

1. **Property Listings:** Users can freely browse through a wide range of properties available for sale or rent. The user-friendly interface allows easy navigation and filtering options.

2. **Search and Filter:** Users can search for properties based on specific locations, property types, price range, amenities, and more, to find listings that match their preferences.

3. **Documentation Hub:** The application offers a central hub where property managers can upload and manage frequently used property documentation, making it easily accessible for clients.

4. **Client Side:**
   - **Property Details:** Clients can view comprehensive details of each property, including images, description, price, amenities, and contact information.
   - **Tour Requests:** Clients have the option to request property tours to get a firsthand experience of the properties they are interested in.
   - **Approval Applications:** Clients can apply for property approval directly through the application.
   - **Monthly Payment:** Clients who are tenants can pay their rent through the website as well, cutting out a need to go anywhere else.

5. **Admin Side:**
